# Purple Team Home-Lab

Welcome to the Purple Teaming Home Lab Project! This initiative is designed to guide security enthusiasts, professionals, and learners in setting up a practical and effective purple teaming environment within the confines of their home lab. Purple teaming is a collaborative approach to security testing, bringing together both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) strategies to enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.

## Project Goals:
### Hands-on Learning : 
- Provide a comprehensive guide for creating a purple teaming home lab that facilitates practical, real-world experience in offensive and defensive security techniques.

### Skill Development :
- Equip users with the skills necessary to simulate and assess security threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents in a controlled environment.

### Community Collaboration : 
- Foster a community of learners and security enthusiasts who can share insights, experiences, and improvements to enhance the overall effectiveness of purple teaming labs.
