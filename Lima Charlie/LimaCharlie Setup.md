# Setting Up Lima Charlie 

**Lima Charlie (LC)** is a freemium **SecOps Cloud Platform** which we'll be using as an alternative of SIEM. Although **LC** is not a SIEM, the solution offers a lot of features that can be of much use for us in this Lab. It only becomes a paid service if we decide to use the service to monitor more than 2 endpoints. 

You can read more about Limacharlie here : **[Getting Started](https://docs.limacharlie.io/docs)**.


For the sake of this Lab, this solution is more than enough.
